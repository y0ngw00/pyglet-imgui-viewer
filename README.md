## Requirements

This is a baseline code for **SNU Computer Graphics (4190.410)**.
This code uses [Pyglet](https://github.com/pyglet/pyglet) which is a cross-platform windowing library under Python 3.8+. 
Supported platforms are:

* Windows 7 or later
* Mac OS X 10.3 or later
* Linux, with the following libraries (most recent distributions will have these in a default installation):

## Installation
Pyglet is installable from PyPI:

    pip install --upgrade --user pyglet

And then clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/IntelligentMOtionlab/SNU_ComputerGraphics.git

You can implement the code easily by:

    python3 main.py
You can then see the result, as shown in the image below.
